# Contributing to Dark Matter projects

Do you want to help make Dark Matter better in some way? Great! That's amazing.
We welcome your help. There are several ways that you can participate.

## Usage

First and foremost, the most important helpful thing that anyone can do is to
deploy Dark Matter Publisher and actually use it. The easiest way to deploy
Dark Matter is the Heroku Deploy Button.

Click this button to easily deploy to Heroku. (You must have a Heroku account.)

## Issues

Find a bug? Want a feature? Questions, concerns? You can file an issue
on GitHub Issues.

https://github.com/darkmatterapp/publisher/issues

Don't worry too much about the format of your issue or how to tag/assign it.
We'll reformat it if it needs it. But what's most important is that you tell
us what's on your mind. :D

## Pull Requests

Did you fix some problem, add some feature, test untested code paths,
write some documentation? Or do you want to? Great. We'd love to have the help.
Here's how it would go best (for us and you), if you want to contribute to
codebase.

1. Fork it
1. Get it running
1. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
1. Write your code and **specs**
1. Run Rubocop (`bundle exec rubocop`), fix any warnings
1. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
1. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
1. Create new Pull Request
